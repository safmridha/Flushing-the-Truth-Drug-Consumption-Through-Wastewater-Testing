The following study was conducted to analyze the wastewater drug metabolite concentrations across seven Canadian cities to unveil trends in Unprescribed and Prescribed drug usage within these cities. 
These trends helped shed light on factors affecting the ongoing drug crises in Canada. The findings were based on a study conducted by Statistics Canada, that monitored the drug metabolite concentrations
every month from the years 2022 to 2023. 

The Data Wrangling and EDA file contains the code required to wrangle the data and create visualizations. Furthermore, regression models were created to uncover any relationship that persists between drugs
that have high correlations with each other in terms of detection. 

The project file includes the fully written project, which consists of all information about the motivation/scope of the study, the guiding questions, information on the dataset, visualizations, 
as well as the findings obtained from the project itself.
